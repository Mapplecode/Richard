3. After installing "Tesseract", Then your file is installed where you want and You'll give the path in your script, such as: (tess.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:UsersMappleAppDataLocalTesseract-OCRtesseract.exe')

4. Next, install Poppler where you want, Give the path in your script inside an image variable. eg: (images = convert_from_path (path, 500, poppler_path=r'C:Program FilesPoppler-0.68.0bin'))
